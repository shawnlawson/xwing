(Yet Another) X-Wing Miniatures Squad Builder
=============================================

What?
-----
This is a squad builder for Fantasy Flight Games' X-Wing Miniatures
game, completely in HTML and JavaScript.  No backend is necessary.
It can theoretically be dropped into any existing site, but since
it uses a lot of styling from [Twitter
Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) it may require
some CSS trickery if you're using some other incompatible framework
(e.g. [Foundation](foundation.zurb.com)).

Can I save squads or share them on `$SOCIAL_NETWORK`?
-----------------------------------------------------
Saving: yes, if you provide a backend that adheres to the API.  See my [X-Wing Backend](https://github.com/geordanr/xwing-backend) project for an example.  Sharing, no.

Aren't there other squad builders out there already?
----------------------------------------------------
Yes.

So...?
------
I wanted a project to work on and screw around with stuff like HAML and Bootstrap and Select2, etc.

When will this be done?
-----------------------
It's an ongoing process.

Building
========

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) to get `npm`.
2. Run `sudo npm install` to install the dependencies listed in `package.json`.
3. Install `sudo npm install -g coffee-script`
4. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) to get `gem`.
5. Install [Bundler](http//bundler.io): `sudo gem install bundler`
6. Use Bundler to install the remaining dependencies listed in `Gemfile`: `sudo bundle install`

Then run `cake build` and all the HTML, CoffeeScript, and CSS files will be created.

Installing
==========

Someday I'll make this a cake target, but until then:

Download and extract [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/), [FontAwesome](fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/), and [Select2](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/) into the top level.

    cp -r *.html fontawesome bootstrap fonts images javascripts select2-* stylesheets coffeescripts $YOUR_WEB_ROOT
